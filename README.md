pocketimport
============

Takes a list of url's and formats them to add to pocket

**UPDATE**
==========

This can now be run using ONLY sort.php, no need for the script.sh script. I have kept them here for viewing however. Please see http://www.nick-web.co.uk/ee/archives/64 for more information!


1) Get a list of URL's to be imported (see http://www.nick-web.co.uk/ee/archives/31 if coming from Google Reader's STARRED items).

2) Run script.sh (tested on OSX 10.8.2 only)

3) Run the php script with url.txt in the same folder

4) Save the resulting page as instapaper-export.html

5) head to http://getpocket.com/import/instapaper/ and select the above file.

6) Press Import
